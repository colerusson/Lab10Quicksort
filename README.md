# Lab10Quicksort
CS235 lab in which we instantiate dynamic arrays, populate them, and use a quicksort algorithm to sort.
"Quicksort is a sorting algorithm developed by Tony Hoare that, on average, makes O(n log n) comparisons to sort n items. It is also known as partition-exchange sort. In the worst case, it makes O(n^2) comparisons, though this behavior is rare. Quicksort is typically faster in practice than other O(n log n) algorithms. Additionally, quicksort's sequential and localized memory references work well with a cache. Quicksort can be implemented as an in-place partitioning algorithm."
